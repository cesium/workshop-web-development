Introduction to Web Development Workshop
=========================================

This repo is a fork from [last year's workshop](https://github.com/fntneves/webdevelopment-workshop).
All examples are done by [Francisco Neves](https://www.github.com/fntneves)

In the html folder you can find all the examples used in ```slides.pdf```, although some may differ.
You can find the original slides in [here](https://speakerdeck.com/francisconeves/web-development-a-really-soft-introduction).
There were quite a few parts improvised during the talk, so we could address specific doubts or questions. Those do not appear in the files.

The bootstrap folder contains all the code for the Bootstrap example.
You can check the responsiveness and how it would appear on your smartphone by decreasing the browser window size.

Feel free to email me with any questions!
